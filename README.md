## How to edit

Firstly install Unity3D (as well as Unity Hub, which you actually have to download first and from there you can choose which version of Unity you want). This project is developed under latest stable version of Unity at the time of the development (Unity 20.3.10f1 LTS).
Once installed add the project root folder (this one) via the Unity Hub and wait for it to install/download all prerequirements.
